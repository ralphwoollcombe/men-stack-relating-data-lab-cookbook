As a User (AAU), I want to sign up for an account and sign in, so that I can access my personal user profile and manage my recipes.
AAU, I want an easy and consistent way to navigate through the site, whether I am signed in or not. I need to quickly access options to sign up, sign in, view my recipes, or sign out, depending on my current status.
AAU, I need a dedicated page to view all my recipes, to easily manage and review what I have created.
AAU, I want to see the full details of each recipe I create.
AAU, I want to easily find and click on an ‘Add New Recipe’ link, which takes me to a form for adding new recipes to my collection.
AAU, after filling out the recipe form, I want to submit it and receive confirmation that the recipe has been saved.
AAU, I need the ability to edit and delete recipes in my collection, allowing me full control over managing my data.
AAU, I want to be able to add new ingredients to my recipe manager. This way, I can keep track of the different ingredients I use across various recipes.
AAU, when adding a new recipe, I want an option to quickly add ingredients that are not already in my list. This will streamline the process of recipe creation, ensuring I can include all necessary ingredients without navigating away from the recipe form.
AAU, I am interested in viewing a list of all other app users, to foster a sense of community within the app.
AAU, I want the option to click on another user’s profile and view all the recipes they have created, to exchange ideas or find inspiration for my own collection.
